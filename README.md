## Mini Project 1 - Debugging Pocket

### Overview

Pocket, made by Read It Later, Inc., is the world’s leading save-for-later service. It currently has more than 10 million active monthly registered users and is integrated into hundreds of leading apps including Flipboard and Twitter. 
Pocket helps people save interesting articles, videos and more from the web for later enjoyment. 
Once saved to Pocket, content is visible on any device — phone, tablet or computer, online or offline.

### Challenge

In pursuit of doing this Pocket has already created a MVP on helping users save-for-later. This MVP was created using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. 
Now they want to convert this MVP into a finished product using Angular.io, which helps them move faster into the market.

### Problem

Few Junior Frontend Developers of the Pocket team have already started working on this but are finding difficulties in migrating to Angular as they are new to the language. 
Assist the Team of Junior Developers by hand-holding them in their journey of migrating the MVP to Angular.

2. Property and Event bindings are incorrectly done
3. 2-way binding not implemented correctly
4. Image paths not specified correctly
5. Child component content not getting rendered

## Instructions

1. Server to unfurl the url is provided with the boilerplate
2. To run the server:
    - install the dependencies 
    - run the server by running command `node app.js` from the root of unfurl-server folder
3. The source code for the solution for debugging resides in the `pocket` folder of the boilerplate code

**4. Debugging is not required for the code written to make service calls for scraping the url**
